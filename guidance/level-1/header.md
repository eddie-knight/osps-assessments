# Header Content

**[< Previous: Getting Started](./getting-started-self-assessment.md)**

Let's kick things off by putting in some basic information about the project and the assessment itself.

## Header

Let's open up the document with some very basic details.

### Introdcution

Your document title will simply be your project’s name followed by “Self-Assessment”.

Use plaintext below the title to specify who did this assessment and who the project maintainers are. In the template document we provide helper text with blanks that you can fill in to get started.

### Table of Contents

If you’re using something like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, you can auto-generate a table of contents.

In Markdown, we can add self-referencing links to our document — these will be functional once we actually create the associated entries.

We may also need to come back and modify this after we’ve added our content. If you decide to create subsections for a complex topic, be sure to add those to the table of contents here. GenAI may help here if your document has significantly extended the template.
