# Open Source Project Security Assessments

In response to a rising demand for standardized security review of open source projects, the Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Assessments project provides a three-tier model for assessing the security state of open source software.

## Approach

OSPS Assessments may come in one of three types: self-assessment, joint-assessment, or third-party assessment. This three-tiered approach is intended to reduce complexity through a "shift left" approach that encourages participation from project maintainers while also reducing overall cost and complexity.

### Getting Started

Visit [the Getting Sarted guide](./guidance/getting-started.md) to determine your first steps, including which of the three assessments is right for your situation. In most cases, it is recommended to start at the lowest level, self-assessments, and work up from there.
