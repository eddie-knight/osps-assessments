# Getting Started

<!-- TODO: Add links throughout -->

This guidance describes security assessments, including what a security assessment is, how it differs from a security audit, how to perform a security assessment, and how to use a completed assessment.  

These contents are heavily informed by the Security Assessment process developed by the CNCF Security Technical Advisory Group and authored by Justin Cappos (STAG Technical Lead). This draws on years of compound experience analyzing and evaluating security products across a wide array of domains. The examples in this text draw from both non-technical anecdotes and a variety of detailed technical examples from Linux Foundation projects in the cloud native space.

It is recommended to follow the guide one step at a time, rather than seeking to read and understand the process in completeness. You will internalize more by attempting the exercises yourself.

## Identifying Your Use Case

How you engage with this guidance will depend on your use case:

### You are preparing to have your software assessed
  
Please do a quick read of the main portion of the book before diving into how to work with us on your self assessment and the remainder of the process.

### You want to learn about threat modeling and software security

Many are helpful to learn about threat modeling and how to assess the security of general projects. Perhaps the least relevant part are the portions of this book that relate to the specifics of Security Assessments. However, those sections can serve as an example of how to implement some of the ideas in the rest of the book in the cloud native space.

### You want to lead or participate in an assessment

To do so, you should read most of the book.  The sections describing how to use an assessment and how to have your project assessed effectively are less helpful, but are still useful to read to understand the process from those perspectives.

### You are evaluating the security posture of a project with a published security assessment

You, the consumer of this hard work, need to understand how best to benefit from a security assessment. The section on consuming assessments is exactly what you need. It may also be useful to read the following section on Security Assessments and Audits, to understand the difference and why you should expect to see relatively few CVEs raised after a security assessment versus a security audit.

## If you're still not ready to get started

As with many things in security there is often not one “correct answer”, despite there being infinite wrong answers. If you would like to ask questions or help improve this guidance, please don't hesitate to engage through the designated [community channels](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
